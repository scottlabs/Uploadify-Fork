I forked Uploadify because I wanted to integrate drag and drop HTML5 support.

I've added a few options to the script:

* dragBox: the element that will listen for drag and drop events

* dragBoxHover: a function called on mouseOver the drag listener element.

* dragBoxOut: a function called on mouseOut from the drag listener element.


That's it! Everything else should just naturally hook into Uploadify.
